The goal of this project is to investigate obesity and related variables in the United States, aiming to uncover insights for public health awareness in the country. The project will utilize variables such as BMI classifications, and their relationship with factors such as exercise rates and cholesterol trends. Through a meticulous exploration of datasets, the research aims to look into the effectiveness of interventions geared towards promoting healthier lifestyles.

The challenges in this project revolve around the complexity of the factors contributing to obesity and the need for a multidimensional analysis. Exploring the interplay between exercise, cholesterol, and obesity requires careful consideration of diverse datasets, certainly involving demographic information, geographic variations, and socioeconomic factors.

Despite these challenges, my hope is to provide meaningful insight to my reader. The exploration will involve data acquisition from sources such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
